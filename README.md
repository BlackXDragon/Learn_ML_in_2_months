# Learn_ML_in_2_months
In order to be able to finish the concepts within the stipulated time, follow the guidelines:

### Prerequisites
- Good knowledge in Python
- Working knowledge of Numpy, Pandas and matplotlib (You can learn these at www.pythonprogramming.net)

## Week 1: Linear Algebra
In week 1, try to finish learning Linear Algebra.
- Learn all the basics of Linear Algebra from 3Blue1Brown channel's playlist: [Essence of linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjBOesZCoqc&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)
- Learn the more advanced concepts from Gilbert Strang's Lectures on [Linear Algebra in MIT OpenCourseWare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZK3O402wf1c&list=PLE7DDD91010BC51F8)
- Search for concepts you don't understand on Wolfram Mathworld
- If you feel you're not up for completely studying the MIT OCW course, learn the following concepts by searching for them on Wolfram Mathworld, StatTrek and YouTube:
 - LU Decomposition
 - Rank of matrix
 - Eigen values and eigen vectors
 - Echelon form
 - Moore Penrose Pseudoinverse

## Week 2: Calculus and Probability theory
Week 2 will cover basics of both, Calculus and Probability
- Watch the playlist of 3Blue1Brown: [Essence of Calculus](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr)
- Learn probability theory and random variables from StatTrek: [Probability Tutorial](https://stattrek.com/tutorials/probability-tutorial.aspx)

## Week 3: Algorithms and Introduction to Machine Learning with Python
- Learn the basics of Algorithm design from the EdX course: [Algorithm Design and Analysis](https://www.edx.org/course/algorithm-design-analysis-pennx-sd3x)
- Finish weeks 1 and 2 of the [Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)

## Week 4: A deeper dive into Machine Learning
- Finish weeks 3, 6, 7, 8 of the course.

## Week 5: Test yourself and get a start onto Deep Learning
- Try working on the [Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview) on Kaggle.
- Start the [Deep Learning specialization by deeplearning.ai](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?skipBrowseRedirect=true&skipRecommendationsRedirect=true&tab=completed) and try to finish week 1 of course 1

## Week 6: Fundamentals of Deep Learning
- Complete courses 1, 2 and 3 of the specialization.

## Week 7: Convolutional Neural Networks
- Complete course 4 of the specialization
- Read the papers specified in the course
- Go through articles about latest developments in computer vision (Great sources: [Siraj Raval](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A), [Two Minute Papers](https://www.youtube.com/user/keeroyz))

## Week 8: Recurrent Neural Networks
- Complete course 5 of the specialization
- Read the papers specified in the course
- Go through articles about latest developments in machine translation, text generation and audio recognition (Great sources: [Siraj Raval](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A), [Two Minute Papers](https://www.youtube.com/user/keeroyz))

## Next Steps
- Read sections 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 20 from [The Deep Learning Book by Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) to learn how to make Deep Learning models better, and get to know about latest research
- Explore and learn about other ML models
- Find Kaggle competitions, enroll in them and try using concepts you've learnt till now to get good results.
- Also try to make your own programs for some of the ideas [here](https://github.com/NirantK/awesome-project-ideas). Remember to try out a variety of problems.
- Also check out [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) free courses for deep learning.


**Have a great time learning!!**
